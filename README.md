# HRM Activity Example

This is an example Pebble watchapp that displays and tracks a user's heart rate
during an activity.

</p>

**NOTE:** This example requires SDK 4.

**NOTE1:** This example runs the heart rate monitor at the maximum sampling rate
(1 sample per second), and as a result will decrease the battery performance of
your Pebble smartwatch.
